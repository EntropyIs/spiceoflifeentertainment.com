                "When he was 16, Adrian was asked to Dj at some guy's 16th birthday party (having never played, or gone to a gig in his life) and for some reason his peers enjoyed it and started booking him.  Too lazy to get a 'real' job, Adrian decided to start depriving these people's parents of their hard earned money and made a business of playing his peers' parties.  This went on to become the 'older kids' parties (the 18 year olds) and the 'real adults' parties (the 21st parties, with the strippers!) and then the proper adults!  (The 30+ crowd.)",
                "Whilst this was all going on Adrian was trying to make music in his bedroom and was doing a terrible job of it and at the same time scoring gigs in and around town at a number of nightclubs.  Adrian started hosting his own parties when he became disheartened with the way things were and decided to release his own music because it was so bad no one wanted to sign it to their label.  (Better to be honest.  Right?) ",

Back then, Naked Age was still a high school student playing around with music software and trying to get heard anywhere he could.  The internet was a new and exciting avenue of expression and promotion and there was a particular webpage which was designed specifically for hosting music long before the ones that are popular now were available.",
                "A friend decided to introduce Naked Age to the webpage and the time came to fill out the registration form.  Taking its sweet arse time to load the completion of registration page, our favourite nude dude went to take a shower and returned only to find a message on the screen.",
                "Can not complete registration.  Your name is already taken.",
                "Begora!  Standing there in all his naked glory, there was naught but one solution to this problem of 'naming' (and shaming) and so, the term “Naked Age” was entered and some 20 something years later it has stuck!  ",
                "Naked Age has subsequently played some of Melbourne's most prominent raves and rave clubs and been banned from those clubs, scenes and online spaces for saying the things that ravers hate to love and love to hate.  Question his politics as you will, his music is unquestionable with a focus on the harder end of the musical stick.  Stuck between House and Techno, Naked Age sailed the seas of Hard House and Hard Trance and came back to shore on a surfboard of Electro.  Renowned for playing silly things like samples of dudes taking a dump in his sets and yes, the jungle Sesame Street theme, yes, Cotton Eye Joe, yes Scatman and yes, YMCA; Naked Age takes 'fun' to a whole new level.  There is no space for showboating here.  No space to throw your hands in the air and wave them around like you just don't care because someone, somewhere always will and so the only thing for it is to break down the dance floor and have some good old fashioned fun!"
